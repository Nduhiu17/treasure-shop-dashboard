## Setup & Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

3. **Backend API:**
   - The dashboard expects a backend running at `http://localhost:8080` with endpoints as defined in `openapi.yaml`.
   - Ensure CORS is enabled on the backend for local development.

## Authentication & Roles
- JWT token is stored in `localStorage` after login.
- User details and roles are also stored in `localStorage`.
- All API requests include the JWT as a Bearer token.
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`.

## Custom Modal for Assigning Writers
- Orders with status `paid`, `feedback`, or `awaiting_assignment` can be assigned to a writer.
- The modal fetches writers from the backend and allows assignment with a single click.

## User Profile Page
- Shows a hero card with user info, role badge, and logout button.
- Orders table is filtered by role:
  - **Admin/Super Admin**: All orders
  - **Writer**: Orders assigned to them
  - **User**: Orders created by them
- Pagination and modern UI/UX.

## Styling & UI
- All UI is built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for a modern, accessible, and responsive experience.
- Loader overlay is shown during all HTTP requests.

## API Reference
- See [`openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml) for all backend endpoints and request/response formats.
